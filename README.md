#Verifying Nameservers on Cloudflare

After the nameservers have been connected, now is the time for you to verify the nameservers on Cloudflare. The verification process is actually very easy, namely checking and making sure whether the domain status is Active on Cloudflare. If the status is still Pending, you need to repeat the steps to change the nameservers for the domain in the Niagahoster Member Area.

Here are the steps to verify nameservers on Cloudflare:

- You can re-login to Cloudflare here: dash.cloudflare.com/login. Enter the account email and password. Then, click Log in.
- You will be redirected to a page to the Home page. Note the status of the domain:

Active: Domain nameservers have been successfully adjusted.
Pending: Still in the propagation period or the domain nameservers have not been adjusted.
